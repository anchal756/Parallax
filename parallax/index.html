            <p class="text">So yeah,that's where we started from.....<br>
                Being friends with you gave me comfort in the very beginning of our friendship.Somewhere I felt so connected then talking hours and hours over calls and chats and doing gossips with you was such an amazing part of my college life. I had shared a great bond with someone after so long.
